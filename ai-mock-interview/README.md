# NextRound AI 

> **Crack Your Next Interview With AI Precision.**

NextRound AI is a powerful MERN-stack platform designed to simulate FAANG-level technical interviews. By leveraging advanced AI to dynamically generate role-specific questions and instantaneously evaluate responses, developers can practice System Design, Data Structures, and Core Architecture in a highly-immersive, analytics-driven environment.

## ✨ Core Features

* **🧠 Dynamic AI Interviews**: Generates precisely targeted questions based on the candidate's chosen Role and Experience brackets.
* **📊 Immediate Performance Analytics**: Granular chart-based tracking of your system scoring over the lifecycle of your interview sessions using `recharts`.
* **🏆 Global Leaderboards**: Mongoose aggregation pipelines track and rank the top-performing developers globally based on rolling average accuracies.
* **📜 Digital Certificate Wallet**: A stunning cryptographic-style wallet dispensing "Gold", "Silver", and "Platinum" architectural mastery certificates upon scoring thresholds.
* **📚 Deep Session History**: Comprehensive tracking grids housing all historical mock-interviews, enabling developers to review AI node feedback on past submissions.
* **🎨 FAANG-Level UI/UX**: Built with an ultra-premium aesthetic utilizing `framer-motion` for physics-based view transitions, deep complex gradients, dark-mode glassmorphism, and skeleton loading states.

##  Getting Started

Provide these instructions to successfully run the environment locally.

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/nextround-ai.git
cd nextround-ai
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
You will need to install Node modules for both the `client` and `server` environments.
```bash
# Install Server modules
cd server
npm install

# Install Client modules
cd ../client
npm install
```

### 3. Environment Pipeline (`.env`)
Create a `.env` file in the root of your `/server` directory and configure the following infrastructure nodes:
```env
PORT=8000
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_hyper_secure_jwt_secret
```
*(Note: If you are using an external AI service like Gemini/OpenAI to power the Coordinator, ensure its API key is also mapped here).*

### 4. Boot Up the Environments
Run the development servers concurrently:

**Terminal 1 (Backend):**
```bash
cd server
npm run dev
```

**Terminal 2 (Frontend):**
```bash
cd client
npm run dev
```

Visit the frontend client at `http://localhost:5173`.
